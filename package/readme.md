# Packagers
This folder contains a list of packagers. Packagers are disk images for our application. They put things together to make up the framework.

Just think of a packager as a brain box of a car. Developers are allowed to build around this concept, share, and innovate.

The default disk image for the framework is ```Lightroom\Packager\Moorexa```. You can create yours or require one via composer.
